    <div class="title">Wings of Solitude</div>
    <div class="paragraph">Scattered throughout New York City, pigeons live independently, sticking to their own kind, and never intruding too much into the lives of humans. 

        They live with us, on top of man-made structures, but never existing in our eyes as a valued being. They're always cast aside, always trampled on, always feeding on the leftovers of those who once domesticated them in the past. 
        
        In a bustling city, they are ignored, unseen, and alone. Often seen as “flying rats”, we don't realize that we can relate to these pigeons in our own way: separated, alone, and forgotten.
