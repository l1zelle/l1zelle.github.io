    <p class="text2">Scattered throughout New York City, pigeons live independently, sticking to their own kind, and never intruding too much into the lives of humans. 

        They live with us, on top of man-made structures, but never existing in our eyes as a valued being. They’re always cast aside, always trampled on, always feeding on the leftovers of those who once domesticated them in the past. 
        
        In a bustling city, they are ignored, unseen, and alone. Often seen as “flying rats”, we don’t realize that we can relate to these pigeons in our own way: separated, alone, and forgotten. 
    
        The goal of this site is to <b>connect the world of humans with pigeons through writings about these birds, humanizing them in a way where we can appreciate pigeons for what they are.</b>

        “The turtledove and pigeon represent mourning innocence, powerlessness, meekness, and humility. No labor is symbolized here, nor is uncomplaining submission, but rather harmlessness, a proclivity to make peace, and even sadness.”
