        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <li>
                <strong>Ground chuck:</strong> preferably an 80 lean/20 fat ratio for juicy burgers
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Crushed crackers:</strong> (or Panko bread crumbs) the best binders for juicy hamburgers
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Worcestershire sauce:</strong> adds a deep beefy, smoky flavor
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Egg:</strong> to bind all the ingredients together without drying
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Milk:</strong> the enzymes help to soften and tenderize the ground beef
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Seasonings:</strong> adds a deep beefy, smoky flavor
            </li>
            <li>
                <em>Note: You may want to add dried spices to create flavor in your patties!</em>

        <h2>Let's Start!</h2>
            <ol>
                <h3>1.</h3> 
                Using a large mixing bowl, add in the ground beef, crushed crackers, egg,
                Worcestershire sauce, milk, and spices.
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <h3>2.</h3> 
                Use your hands to thoroughly mix until the mixture is smooth.
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <h3>3.</h3> 
                Once smooth, press the meat down in a bowl into an even disk shape.
                <br>Use a knife to cut and divide the patty mixture into 6 - 1/3 pound grill or skillet patties.
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <h3>4.</h3> 
                Set out a baking sheet to hold the patties.
                <br> One at a time, gather the patty mix and press firmly into patties of your desired thickness.
                <br><em>It is recommended that the patties be slightly larger than the buns they'll be served on (they'll shrink a bit while cooking)</em>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <h3>5.</h3> 
                Place the formed patties on the baking sheet.
                <br> With thick patties, press an indentation in the center of each patty (so they don't puff up while cooking)
                <br><em>You can stack the patties with sheets of wax paper between layers if needed.</em>
            </ol>
            <ol>
                <h3>6.</h3> 
                Preheat the grill or a skillet to medium heat, approximately 350-400 degress F.
                <br><br><strong>For thick patties:</strong> Grill or fry the patties for 3-4 minutes per side for a medium burger.
                <br><strong>For thin patties:</strong> Cook on the griddle for 2 minutes per side
                <br><br><em>Ideally, you only want to flip your burgers <em>once</em> or <em>twice</em> while cooking!</em>
            </ol>
