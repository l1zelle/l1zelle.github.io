            The Chasm represents time and how it is a never-ending cycle where one can simply fall into. Each layer of the chasm is linked to real-time data as it continuously rotates around the central axis. Starting from the outermost layer, the first one symbolizes milliseconds, the next one symbolizes seconds, followed by minutes, and the last one represents hours. Hover over the chasm, and it will slowly envelop the user, as if one is falling into it.
